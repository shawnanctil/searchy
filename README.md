Search Mining

The following scripts allow you to have a little fun with Google's search suggest feature and fetch the top 10 results from Google searches for a list of keywords.

I adapted the code from two excellent projects:
* Pattern.search: http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pages/pattern-search
* Rastrau's Geographies of Autocomplete Analysis: https://github.com/rastrau/Google-Autocomplete-analysis/

There are a number of areas for improvement, but the code works.
